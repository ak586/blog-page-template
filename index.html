        <p>
          Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design
          and development! In this exercise, we'll play around with some of the
          common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice
          blog post-like web page.
        </p>

      <h2>All About Typography</h2>

      <p class="headline">
        Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the reader's
        attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important information
        in a web page. You can use <span> text-transform: uppercase;</span> to
        make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab
        attention!
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
        you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components
        of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
        headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is
        intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
        inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
        difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At
        large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are
        considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where
        serif characters start and where they end.
      </p>

      <p>
        But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
        Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
        quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
        it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it
        some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience
        Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way
        that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
        Differentiating our different typography components visually makes
        information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

      <!-- new section -->
      <h3>a new section</h3>
      <p>
        And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a
        <span>hr</span> element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new
        heading. Isn't putting content together fun? Notice as well that when we
        entered in the <span>H3</span> content, it was all lowercase, but now
        it's in a nice Title Case, where the first letter of each word is
        capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using
        <span>text-transform: capitalize;</span>
        we can implement title cased content.

      <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
      <h4>
        <code>px</code>
        pixels
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the
        browser sets the root font size to <span>16px</span>, but you can change
        the font size in the <span>body</span> element or any other HTML element
        by setting <span>font-size</span>
        to any number of px.
      </p>

      <h4><code>em</code></h4>
      <p>
        <span>em</span> units size font relative to the parent element. For
        example, if the <span>body</span> element is <span>16px</span>, and a
        nested <span>div</span> element's font size is set to
        <span>1.5em</span>, the browser will multiply <span>16px</span> x 1.5,
        resulting in <span>24px</span> font in the <span>div</span>.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <code>rem</code>
        (root em)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Root <span>em</span> units are similar to <span>em</span>, but they are
        relative to the root font size instead of the parent element of whatever
        is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of
        the body element) is set to <span>16px</span>, and we have a
        <span>p</span> element nested many layers down with a
        <span>font-size</span> set to <span>2rem</span>, that paragraph will
        have <span>32px</span> font. If the body font size ever changes, this
        paragraph will also change accordingly.
      </p>

      <h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
      <p>
        Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using
        <span>em</span> or <span>rem </span> over <span>px</span>, since they
        make responsive typography that scales up and down across different
        device widths much easier. Using px for your font sizes is not as
        dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all the
        various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is not
        the most scalable approach to typography. Between <span>em </span> and <span>rem</span>, rem has a
        nice advantage of all elements being relative to one single root font
        value, where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies
        can still be hard to manage with em units. When writing responsive
        styles, rem allows you to simply update the root font size at different
        screen sizes and all elements using rem units will adjust themselves
        accordingly creating a super easy-to-manage typography size system. In
        small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but it's
        always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles that may
        not be responsive or dynamic.
